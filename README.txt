All the following python files except "oneRobotAtCenterKnown.py" simulate the algorithms described in the 
"Randomized Algorithm Simulations" section of my honours project. Each algorithm has a visual representation
and a 'quick simulation' version which quickly simulates 100 000 runs of the algorithms without the visual
render. For the visual representations, simply press the space bar after the algorithm runs once in order 
to run it again.

oneRobotAtCenterKnown.py
an unfinished simulation for the scenario where one robot starts at the center of the disk and another 
robot starts in a random location inside the disk. The case where a robot finds the exit before the other 
reaches the perimeter is not simulated properly.

twoRobotsAtCenter.py and twoRobotsAtCenterQuickSimulation.py
Algorithm explained in section 7.1 of my honours project

twoRobotsNotAtCenterUnknown.py and twoRobotsNotAtCenterUnknownQuickSimulation.py
Algorithm explained in section 7.2 of my honours project

twoRobotsNotAtCenterKnown.py and twoRobotsNotAtCenterKnownQuickSimulation.py
Algorithm explained in section 7.3 of my honours project

To run one of the programs, simply open a terminal and type in "python FILENAME" or whatever command your
machine uses for executing python files inside of a terminal.
